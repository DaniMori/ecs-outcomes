	abstract = {Direct reports of subjective well-being may have a useful role in the measurement of consumer preferences and social welfare, if they can be done in a credible way. Can well-being be measured by a subjective survey, even approximately? In this paper, we discuss research on how individuals' responses to subjective well-being questions vary with their circumstances and other factors. We will argue that it is fruitful to distinguish among different conceptions of utility rather than presume to measure a single, unifying concept that motivates all human choices and registers all relevant feelings and experiences. While various measures of well-being are useful for some purposes, it is important to recognize that subjective well-being measures features of individuals' perceptions of their experiences, not their utility as economists typically conceive of it. Those perceptions are a more accurate gauge of actual feelings if they are reported closer to the time of, and in direct reference to, the actual experience. We conclude by proposing the U- index, a misery index of sorts, which measures the proportion of time that people spend in an unpleasant state, and has the virtue of not requiring a cardinal conception of individuals' feelings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study of well-being is becoming a priority in social sciences. The Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) was developed to assess affective states. The aim of the present study was to validate an abbreviated version of the DRM designed for administration in population studies, and to assess its test-retest properties.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 1560 adults from Jodhpur (India) were interviewed using an abbreviated version of the DRM, and a week later they were re-interviewed using the original long version of the DRM, after which the abbreviated version of the DRM was compared with the original version. A regression model considering interaction terms was employed to analyse the impact of sociodemographic characteristics on net affect. Test-retest reliability was assessed, and found to be moderate. Positive affect showed more test-retest reliability than negative affect, while net affect had more temporal stability than U-index. The affect of sets A, B, and C, taken together, had a moderate predictive ability compared with the affect obtained using the full version of the DRM: AUC = 0.67 for positive affect; 0.66 for net affect; 0.61 for negative affect; and 0.60 for the U-index. Household income, gender, and setting all had a significant impact on net affect.
CONCLUSIONS: Net affect and positive affect showed moderate temporal stability, whereas negative affect and the U-index showed fair temporal stability. Evaluating the affective state using the abbreviated version of the DRM provides a profile of the population similar to that of the full version. The results provide considerable support for using the short version of the DRM as an instrument to measure subjective well-being in large population surveys.},

The present study aimed to validate an abbreviated version of the DRM in a representative sample of the population in seven countries (China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, and Spain), and to examine whether there are country differences in affect and in the relationships among the activities based on the similarity of the affect associated with each of them.
METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 47,222 non-institutionalized adults from seven countries, using an abbreviated version of the DRM. A cluster analysis was carried out to classify activities on the basis of the similarity of the associated affect. In each country, the factorial structure of the affect adjectives was tested through Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Internal consistency and construct validity were also assessed. Moreover, the differences in affect across countries and the diurnal cycles of affect were evaluated.
RESULTS: The DRM showed adequate psychometric properties regarding reliability and construct validity in all countries. Respondents from Ghana and South Africa reported more positive net affect whereas Indian respondents reported less positive net affect. Most of the countries showed a similar diurnal variation of affect, which tended to improve throughout the day.
CONCLUSIONS: The results show that this abbreviated version of the DRM is a useful tool for multi-country evaluation of experienced well-being.},

A total of 2,629 adults from Mexico and 4,583 from Spain were interviewed. Information was obtained using an abbreviated version of the DRM, which had been translated into Spanish. Reliability, validity, and the structure of affect were assessed and compared between countries. The diurnal variation of affect, the changes in affect along the life span, time use, and the relationship between affect and socio-demographic characteristics were also analysed. Adequate psychometric properties for the Spanish-language version of the abbreviated DRM were found in both the Mexican and the Spanish samples, and affect tended to improve along the life span in both countries. However, net affect did not have the same distribution function (Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic = 0.25, p {\textless} 0.001) in both countries, being higher in Spain. Moreover, both samples showed opposite patterns in the diurnal variation of affect. The results showed that the Spanish-language version of the DRM is a feasible and valid method to measure affect, its diurnal rhythms, and time use in large-scale surveys.

Positive Feelings, Negative Feelings, and the balance between the two ({SPANE}-P, N, B); and 3. Positive Thinking. The {PWB} scale is a short 8–item summary survey of the person’s self-perceived functioning in important areas such as relationships, self-esteem, purpose and meaning, and optimism. The scale is substantially correlated with other psychological well-being scales, but is briefer. The scale provides a single overall psychological well-being score and does not yield scores for various components of well-being. The Scale of Positive and Negative Experience ({SPANE}) yields a score for positive experience and feelings (6 items), a score for negative experience and feelings (6 items), and the two can be combined to create an experience balance score. This 12-item brief scale has a number of desirable features compared to earlier measures of positive and negative feelings. In particular, the scale assesses with a few items a broad range of negative and positive experiences and feelings, not just those of a certain type, and is based on the frequency of feelings during the past month. A scale to measure Positive Thinking is also presented. Basic psychometric statistics are presented for the scales based on 573 college students at five universities.},

The aim of the present study was to analyze the measurement equivalence of the Day Reconstruction Method in its brief version, using nationally representative samples from Finland, Poland, and Spain obtained within the COURAGE in Europe project. The goodness-of-fit of a two-correlated-factors model and the reliability of the scores obtained were assessed. Cross-country invariance was tested employing a multiple group confirmatory factor analysis, through sequential constraint imposition. In each country, measurement invariance was tested across time frames (morning, afternoon and evening) and days of the week (weekday and weekend). The results found support for the hypothesis of a two-correlated-factors (positive and negative affect) structure; the reliability of the positive, the negative and the net affect scores showed appropriate values. A high equivalence across the three national samples was found: all items except one showed strong measurement invariance indicating that respondents from Finland, Poland, and Spain attribute the same meaning to the latent construct under study, and the levels of the underlying items are equal in all three countries. Similar results were found for the measurement equivalence across time frames and days of the week. Our findings support the assumption of comparability across the different samples considered; in general, higher positive affect and lower negative affect were found in Finland, in the evening and at the weekend.},

The tests selected for this study measured the primary cognitive manifestations of AD across a range of severity of the disorder, and discriminated between normal subjects and those with mild and moderate dementia. The batteries also detected deterioration of language, memory, praxis, and general intellectual status in subjects returning for reassessment 1 year later. Interrater and testretest reliabilities were substantial. Long-term observations of this cohort are in progress in an effort to validate the clinical and neuropsychological assessments and to confirm the diagnosis by postmortem examinations.

Design and Methods: We used data from 413 caregivers of cognitively impaired older adults referred to a memory clinic. We collected information on caregiver burden with the 22-item ZBI, and information about dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and the frequency of problem behaviors among care recipients. We used factor analysis and item–total correlations to reduce the number of items while taking into consideration diagnosis and change scores. Results: We produced a 12-item version (short) and a 4-item version (screening) of the ZBI. Correlations between the short and the full version ranged from 0.92 to 0.97, and from 0.83 to 0.93 for the screening version. Correlations between the three versions and ADL and problem behaviors were similar. We further investigated the behavior of the short version with a two-way analysis of variance and found that it produced identical results to the full version. Implications: The short and screening versions of the ZBI produced results comparable to those of the full version. Reducing the number of items did not affect the properties of the ZBI, and it may lead to easier administration of the instrument.},

observation that there does not appear to be a direct relationship
between the degree of brain pathology or brain damage and the
clinical manifestation of that damage. This paper attempts to
develop a coherent theoretical account of reserve. One convenient
subdivision of reserve models revolves around whether they envision
reserve as a passive process, such as in brain reserve or
threshold, or see the brain as actively attempting to cope with
or compensate for pathology, as in cognitive reserve. Cognitive
reserve may be based on more efficient utilization of brain
networks or of enhanced ability to recruit alternate brain networks
as needed. A distinction is suggested between reserve, the ability
to optimize or maximize normal performance, and compensation,
an attempt to maximize performance in the face of brain damage
by using brain structures or networks not engaged when the brain
is not damaged. Epidemiologic and imaging data that help to
develop and support the concept of reserve are presented.

It began with the enunciation of a framework that specified a parsimonious set of key goals to which health systems contribute, and the first set of figures on goal attainment and health system efficiency in countries that were Members of the Organization was published in The World Health Report 2000.  This book provides a uniquely comprehensive exploration of many different facets of health systems performance assessment. It will be relevant for researchers, students and decision-makers seeking a more detailed understanding of concepts, methods and the latest empirical findings. While most authors in this volume take a global perspective, the findings have important implications for the development of national performance frameworks and the creation of a culture of accountability.},

In a study of 50 psychiatric patients and informants, the questionnaire version of the list (LTE-Q) was shown to have high test-retest reliability, and good agreement with informant information. Concurrent validity, based on the criterion of independently rated adversity derived from a semistructured life events interview, making use of the Life Events and Difficulties Scales (LEDS) method developed by Brown \& Harris, showed both high specificity and sensitivity. The LTE-Q is particularly recommended for use in psychiatric, psychological and social studies in which other intervening variables such as social support, coping, and cognitive variables are of interest, and resources do not allow for the use of extensive interview measures of stress.},

Introducción
El acuerdo entre-examinadores es un aspecto fundamental en la planificación de cualquier trabajo de investigación donde la principal herramienta diagnóstica es la entrevista clínica. El objetivo de este estudio es valorar el acuerdo entre-examinadores de un instrumento de evaluación de la conducta suicida (Protocolo breve de evaluación del suicidio) utilizando las valoraciones de múltiples observadores en una sola sesión.
Método
Durante la fase piloto de un estudio clínico multicéntrico centrado en la monitorización de intentos de suicidio, 32 examinadores evaluaron el vídeo de la entrevista clínica a un paciente simulado con conducta suicida. Para identificar los ítems en los que existía una mayor discordancia y a los examinadores cuyo criterio se alejaba más del acuerdo general, se utilizó el método Detection Of Multiple Examiners Not In Consensus (DOMENIC).
Resultado
El acuerdo interexaminadores osciló entre pobre ({\textless}70\%) y excelente (90-100\%). En la escala de acontecimientos vitales estresantes el nivel de acuerdo osciló entre 48,4 y 97\%; en la escala problemas psicosociales del DSM-IV, entre 75,5 y 100\%; en la escala de evaluación de la actividad global fue de 82,58\%; en la escala de intencionalidad suicida, osciló entre 67,5 y 97\%; en la escala de ideación suicida, entre 63,5 y 100\% y en la escala de letalidad del intento de suicidio fue de 88,39\%. En general, los examinadores mostraron un nivel de acuerdo adecuado tanto en las puntuaciones globales de cada escala como en cada ítem en particular.
Conclusiones
El diseño propuesto permite evaluar el acuerdo entre-examinadores de una forma eficiente (en una única sesión). Además, con respecto al Protocolo breve de evaluación del suicidio, el acuerdo entre-examinadores fue apropiado.
Introduction
Inter-rater agreement is a crucial aspect in the planning and performance of a clinical trial in which the main assessment tool is the clinical interview. The main objectives of this study are to study the inter-rater agreement of a tool for the assessment of suicidal behavior (Brief Suicide Questionnaire) and to examine whether the inter-examiner agreement when multiple ratings are made on a single subject is an efficient method to assess the reliability of an instrument.
Method
In the context of designing a multicenter clinical trial, 32 psychiatrists assessed a videotaped clinical interview of a patient with suicidal behavior. In order to identify those items in which a greater level of discordance existed and detect the examiners whose ratings differed significantly from the average ratings, we used the DOMENIC method (Detecion of Multiple Examiners Not in Consensus).
Results
Inter-rater agreement was between poor ({\textless}70\%) to excelent (90-100\%. Inter-rater agreement in Brugha's list of threatening experiences ranged from 75.5 and 100\%; in the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale was 82.58\%; in the Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale, ranged from 67.5 and 97\%; in the Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation, ranged from 63.5 and 100\%; and in the Lethality Rating Scale was 88.39\%. On the whole, the level of agreement among raters, both in general scores and in particular items, was appropriate.
Conclusion
The proposed design allows the assessment of the inter-rater agreement in an efficient way (only in one session). In addition, regarding the Brief Suicide Questionnaire, inter-raters agreement was appropriate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burden on caregivers has been extensively studied, but the patient's own feelings of being a burden have rarely been examined. Such feelings may lead to distress and can complicate relations with the caregiver. This report describes the development and preliminary validation of a scale to measure patient-perceived burden.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A conceptual framework and scale items were derived from previous literature and from qualitative interviews with patients and health professionals. Following content validity and item clarity analyses, a 25-item scale was developed. This was then administered in a construct validation to 100 outpatients undergoing hemodialysis.
RESULTS: Discriminant validity coefficients showed that burden scores were independent of age, education, and time on dialysis. Convergent analyses showed modest correlations with the number of comorbid conditions (r = 0.20, P {\textless} 0.04), functional status (r = 0.26, P {\textless} 0.01), physical function (r = 0.30, P {\textless} 0.01), and mental health (r = 0.39, P {\textless} 0.01). Alpha internal consistency was 0.92 and factor analyses revealed a single main factor. A 10-item abbreviation (alpha = 0.85) is therefore proposed.
CONCLUSION: The self-perceived burden scale shows promise as a measure to identify patients in emotional distress due to feelings of being a burden on others, and as an outcome measure in intervention studies.},

	abstract = {Background:One of the main health-related worries for older adults is becoming dependent. Even healthy older adults may worry about becoming dependent, generating guilt feelings due to the anticipation of future needs that others must solve. The guilt associated with self-perception as a burden has not been studied in older adults, and there is no instrument available to measure these feelings.Aims:To adapt the Self-Perceived Burden Scale (SPBS; Cousineau et al., 2003) for the assessment of feelings of guilt for perceiving oneself as a burden for the family in older adults without explicit functional or cognitive impairment.Method:Participants were 298 older adults living independently in the community. Participants completed the assessment protocol, which included measures of guilt associated with self-perception as a burden, depressive and anxious symptomatology, self-perceived burden, and sociodemographic information.Results:Results from exploratory, parallel and confirmatory factor analyses suggest that the scale, named Guilt associated with Self-Perception as a Burden Scale (G-SPBS), has a unidimensional structure, explaining 57.04\% of the variance of guilt. Good reliability was found (Cronbach’s alpha = .94). The results revealed significant (p {\textless} .01) positive associations with depressive and anxious symptomatology.Discussion:These findings suggest that the G-SPBS shows good psychometric properties which endorse its use with healthy community older adults. Also, guilt associated with perceiving oneself as a burden seems to be a relevant variable that can contribute to improving our understanding of psychological distress in older adults.},
