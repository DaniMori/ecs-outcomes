	abstract = {The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) has developed brief, comprehensive, and reliable batteries of clinical and neuropsychological tests for assessment of patients with the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We administered these batteries in a standardized manner to more than 350 subjects with a diagnosis of AD and 275 control subjects who were enrolled in a nationwide registry by a consortium of 16 university medical centers. The tests selected for this study measured the primary cognitive manifestations of AD across a range of severity of the disorder, and discriminated between normal subjects and those with mild and moderate dementia. The batteries also detected deterioration of language, memory, praxis, and general intellectual status in subjects returning for reassessment 1 year later. Interrater and testretest reliabilities were substantial. Long-term observations of this cohort are in progress in an effort to validate the clinical and neuropsychological assessments and to confirm the diagnosis by postmortem examinations. Although information on validation is limited thus far, the CERAD batteries appear to fill a need for a standardized, easily administered, and reliable instrument for evaluating persons with AD in multicenter research studies as well as in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of the study was to develop a short and a screening version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) that would be suitable across diagnostic groups of cognitively impaired older adults, and that could be used for cross-sectional, longitudinal, and intervention studies. Design and Methods: We used data from 413 caregivers of cognitively impaired older adults referred to a memory clinic. We collected information on caregiver burden with the 22-item ZBI, and information about dependence in activities of daily living (ADLs) and the frequency of problem behaviors among care recipients. We used factor analysis and item–total correlations to reduce the number of items while taking into consideration diagnosis and change scores. Results: We produced a 12-item version (short) and a 4-item version (screening) of the ZBI. Correlations between the short and the full version ranged from 0.92 to 0.97, and from 0.83 to 0.93 for the screening version. Correlations between the three versions and ADL and problem behaviors were similar. We further investigated the behavior of the short version with a two-way analysis of variance and found that it produced identical results to the full version. Implications: The short and screening versions of the ZBI produced results comparable to those of the full version. Reducing the number of items did not affect the properties of the ZBI, and it may lead to easier administration of the instrument.},

	abstract = {The idea of reserve against brain damage stems from the repeated
observation that there does not appear to be a direct relationship
between the degree of brain pathology or brain damage and the
clinical manifestation of that damage. This paper attempts to
develop a coherent theoretical account of reserve. One convenient
subdivision of reserve models revolves around whether they envision
reserve as a passive process, such as in brain reserve or
threshold, or see the brain as actively attempting to cope with
or compensate for pathology, as in cognitive reserve. Cognitive
reserve may be based on more efficient utilization of brain
networks or of enhanced ability to recruit alternate brain networks
as needed. A distinction is suggested between reserve, the ability
to optimize or maximize normal performance, and compensation,
an attempt to maximize performance in the face of brain damage
by using brain structures or networks not engaged when the brain
is not damaged. Epidemiologic and imaging data that help to
develop and support the concept of reserve are presented.

In a study of 50 psychiatric patients and informants, the questionnaire version of the list (LTE-Q) was shown to have high test-retest reliability, and good agreement with informant information. Concurrent validity, based on the criterion of independently rated adversity derived from a semistructured life events interview, making use of the Life Events and Difficulties Scales (LEDS) method developed by Brown \& Harris, showed both high specificity and sensitivity. The LTE-Q is particularly recommended for use in psychiatric, psychological and social studies in which other intervening variables such as social support, coping, and cognitive variables are of interest, and resources do not allow for the use of extensive interview measures of stress.},

Introducción
El acuerdo entre-examinadores es un aspecto fundamental en la planificación de cualquier trabajo de investigación donde la principal herramienta diagnóstica es la entrevista clínica. El objetivo de este estudio es valorar el acuerdo entre-examinadores de un instrumento de evaluación de la conducta suicida (Protocolo breve de evaluación del suicidio) utilizando las valoraciones de múltiples observadores en una sola sesión.
Método
Durante la fase piloto de un estudio clínico multicéntrico centrado en la monitorización de intentos de suicidio, 32 examinadores evaluaron el vídeo de la entrevista clínica a un paciente simulado con conducta suicida. Para identificar los ítems en los que existía una mayor discordancia y a los examinadores cuyo criterio se alejaba más del acuerdo general, se utilizó el método Detection Of Multiple Examiners Not In Consensus (DOMENIC).
Resultado
El acuerdo interexaminadores osciló entre pobre ({\textless}70\%) y excelente (90-100\%). En la escala de acontecimientos vitales estresantes el nivel de acuerdo osciló entre 48,4 y 97\%; en la escala problemas psicosociales del DSM-IV, entre 75,5 y 100\%; en la escala de evaluación de la actividad global fue de 82,58\%; en la escala de intencionalidad suicida, osciló entre 67,5 y 97\%; en la escala de ideación suicida, entre 63,5 y 100\% y en la escala de letalidad del intento de suicidio fue de 88,39\%. En general, los examinadores mostraron un nivel de acuerdo adecuado tanto en las puntuaciones globales de cada escala como en cada ítem en particular.
Conclusiones
El diseño propuesto permite evaluar el acuerdo entre-examinadores de una forma eficiente (en una única sesión). Además, con respecto al Protocolo breve de evaluación del suicidio, el acuerdo entre-examinadores fue apropiado.
Introduction
Inter-rater agreement is a crucial aspect in the planning and performance of a clinical trial in which the main assessment tool is the clinical interview. The main objectives of this study are to study the inter-rater agreement of a tool for the assessment of suicidal behavior (Brief Suicide Questionnaire) and to examine whether the inter-examiner agreement when multiple ratings are made on a single subject is an efficient method to assess the reliability of an instrument.
Method
In the context of designing a multicenter clinical trial, 32 psychiatrists assessed a videotaped clinical interview of a patient with suicidal behavior. In order to identify those items in which a greater level of discordance existed and detect the examiners whose ratings differed significantly from the average ratings, we used the DOMENIC method (Detecion of Multiple Examiners Not in Consensus).
Results
Inter-rater agreement was between poor ({\textless}70\%) to excelent (90-100\%. Inter-rater agreement in Brugha's list of threatening experiences ranged from 75.5 and 100\%; in the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale was 82.58\%; in the Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale, ranged from 67.5 and 97\%; in the Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation, ranged from 63.5 and 100\%; and in the Lethality Rating Scale was 88.39\%. On the whole, the level of agreement among raters, both in general scores and in particular items, was appropriate.
Conclusion
The proposed design allows the assessment of the inter-rater agreement in an efficient way (only in one session). In addition, regarding the Brief Suicide Questionnaire, inter-raters agreement was appropriate.},

	doi = {10.1186/1477-7525-11-177},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a need for short, specific instruments that assess quality of life (QOL) adequately in the older adult population. The aims of the present study were to obtain evidence on the validity of the inferences that could be drawn from an instrument to measure QOL in the aging population (people 50+ years old), and to test its psychometric properties.
METHODS: The instrument, WHOQOL-AGE, comprised 13 positive items, assessed on a five-point rating scale, and was administered to nationally representative samples (n = 9987) from Finland, Poland, and Spain. Cronbach's alpha was employed to assess internal consistency reliability, whereas the validity of the questionnaire was assessed by means of factor analysis, graded response model, Pearson's correlation coefficient and unpaired t-test. Normative values were calculated across countries and for different age groups.
RESULTS: The satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices confirmed that the factorial structure of WHOQOL-AGE comprises two first-order factors. Cronbach's alpha was 0.88 for factor 1, and 0.84 for factor 2. Evidence supporting a global score was found with a second-order factor model, according to the goodness-of-fit indices: CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.073. Convergent validity was estimated at r = 0.75 and adequate discriminant validity was also found. Significant differences were found between healthy individuals (74.19 ± 13.21) and individuals with at least one chronic condition (64.29 ± 16.29), supporting adequate known-groups validity.
CONCLUSIONS: WHOQOL-AGE has shown good psychometric properties in Finland, Poland, and Spain. Therefore, considerable support is provided to using the WHOQOL-AGE to measure QOL in older adults in these countries, and to compare the QOL of older and younger adults.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Burden on caregivers has been extensively studied, but the patient's own feelings of being a burden have rarely been examined. Such feelings may lead to distress and can complicate relations with the caregiver. This report describes the development and preliminary validation of a scale to measure patient-perceived burden.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A conceptual framework and scale items were derived from previous literature and from qualitative interviews with patients and health professionals. Following content validity and item clarity analyses, a 25-item scale was developed. This was then administered in a construct validation to 100 outpatients undergoing hemodialysis.
RESULTS: Discriminant validity coefficients showed that burden scores were independent of age, education, and time on dialysis. Convergent analyses showed modest correlations with the number of comorbid conditions (r = 0.20, P {\textless} 0.04), functional status (r = 0.26, P {\textless} 0.01), physical function (r = 0.30, P {\textless} 0.01), and mental health (r = 0.39, P {\textless} 0.01). Alpha internal consistency was 0.92 and factor analyses revealed a single main factor. A 10-item abbreviation (alpha = 0.85) is therefore proposed.
CONCLUSION: The self-perceived burden scale shows promise as a measure to identify patients in emotional distress due to feelings of being a burden on others, and as an outcome measure in intervention studies.},

Even healthy older adults may worry about becoming dependent, generating guilt feelings due to the anticipation of future needs that others must solve. The guilt associated with self-perception as a burden has not been studied in older adults, and there is no instrument available to measure these feelings.Aims:To adapt the Self-Perceived Burden Scale (SPBS; Cousineau et al., 2003) for the assessment of feelings of guilt for perceiving oneself as a burden for the family in older adults without explicit functional or cognitive impairment.Method:Participants were 298 older adults living independently in the community. Participants completed the assessment protocol, which included measures of guilt associated with self-perception as a burden, depressive and anxious symptomatology, self-perceived burden, and sociodemographic information.Results:Results from exploratory, parallel and confirmatory factor analyses suggest that the scale, named Guilt associated with Self-Perception as a Burden Scale (G-SPBS), has a unidimensional structure, explaining 57.04\% of the variance of guilt. Good reliability was found (Cronbach’s alpha = .94). The results revealed significant (p {\textless} .01) positive associations with depressive and anxious symptomatology.Discussion:These findings suggest that the G-SPBS shows good psychometric properties which endorse its use with healthy community older adults. Also, guilt associated with perceiving oneself as a burden seems to be a relevant variable that can contribute to improving our understanding of psychological distress in older adults.},
