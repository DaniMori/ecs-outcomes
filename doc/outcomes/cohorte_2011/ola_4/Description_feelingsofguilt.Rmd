# Variable description

The feeling of guilt about being a burden to the caregiver is one of the main 
discomforts experienced by the elderly. It is one of the most common 
health-related concerns as they become dependent and take a toll on the 
resources of their family members. 

The original scale proposed by Cousineau et al. (2003) "Self-Perceived Burden
Scale" assesses the feeling of guilt for perceiving oneself as a burden to the 
family in older adults without any functional or cognitive impairment.  
It consists of 25 Likert-type scale items, from 1 ("never or almost never") 
to 5 ("almost always"). 

The version adapted by Pedroso-Chaparro et al. (2021) uses an abbreviated 
version of 16 items. In Wave 4 in Age with Health a reduced version of this 
abbreviated version of only 5 items has been used.

Mainly two facets are distinguished:
- __Guilt associated with the perception of being a burden.__ In Edad con Salud
these items would be composed of items `q6724_guilt1_s3` (I feel guilty for 
overburdening my family for taking care of me); 
`q6727_extra_s3` (I feel good receiving care from my family); 
`q6725_guilt2_s3` (I feel guilty because my family has lost control of their
life in order to take care of me); `q6726_guilt3_s3` (I feel guilty because my 
family is helping me beyond their capacity). 

- __Self-perception of being a burden to the family.__ Item `q6728_extra_s3` 
(I think I make things easy for my family). 

It is assumed that there is a relationship between both variables, 
since they would be part of the same phenomenon. 

# Explanation of how the variables were created

- __Guilt associated with the perception of being a burden.__ In Edad con Salud
these items would be composed of items `q6724_guilt1_s3` (I feel guilty for 
overburdening my family for taking care of me); 
`q6727_extra_s3` (I feel good receiving care from my family); 
`q6725_guilt2_s3` (I feel guilty because my family has lost control of their
life in order to take care of me); `q6726_guilt3_s3` (I feel guilty because my 
family is helping me beyond their capacity). 
  - __guilt_burden_s3__: Sum of the aforementioned items. Item `q6727_extra_s3`
    is an inverse item, so it is necessary to recode the values for a correct
    interpretation of the score. This is a direct score.
  - __guilt_burden_100_s3__: Same as above, but in 0 to 100 scale. This 
  transformation is done following the formula `newvar = ((var - min)/(max-min))*100`,
  which first subtracts the minimum value of the original range (4) from each 
  value of var. It then divides the result by the range of the original variable
  (18-4=14) to get a proportion between 0 and 1. Finally, it multiplies this 
  proportion by the range of the new variable (100) to get the rescaled value.

- __Self-perception of being a burden to the family.__ Item `q6728_extra_s3` 
(I think I make things easy for my family). 
   - __burden_to_family_s3__: Direct score of the item, which has to be reversed
    for score to maintain its correct interpretation.

Rising scores indicating increasing burden.
