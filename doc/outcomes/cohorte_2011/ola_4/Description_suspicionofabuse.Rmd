# Variable description

The Spanish version of the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index [@pérez-rojo2008] is an
adaptation of the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI) [@yaffe_development_2008],
a brief instrument with direct questions aimed at detecting suspicion of abuse
in older people (aged +64) without cognitive impairment. It is made up of five
questions addressed to the elderly person and one to the professional (not used
in this survey), which are asked in the course of an encounter between the
elderly person and the professional in the consultation room and are formulated
by the professional using simple language. The first question focuses on the
assessment of the level of dependency of the elderly person for some basic or
instrumental activity of daily living; in this adaptation, this item is expanded
as a module assessing whether there is a dependence and whether it is
problematic / neglected. The remaining questions refer to different types of
abuse: physical and sexual, psychological, financial, and neglect. A dichotomous
item for each type of abuse (0=No; 1=Yes) is followed by a Likert-scale item
about the frequency of abuse, ranging from 1 (ocassional) to 4 (often). A
positive response to any of the dichotomous items would indicate suspicion of
abuse. Please note that in our version we do not use the item referring to the
professional. However, the "dependency" part is considered when assessing the
suspicion of abuse.

In this survey, the questions refer to situations that occurred in the 12 months
before the completion of the questionnaire, and only participants aged 65 and
older were assessed.

In addition to the suspicion of abuse, the following variables, comparable to
wave 3, are created: four variables indicating the presence and frequency of
abuse (one for each type), and a variable indicating the dependency of the
elderly and its type.

# Explanation of how the variables were created

We have followed the conventions of Wave 3 (dependency, each specific type of
abuse) and we added an additional variable based on the literature:

-   Create a variable indicating the **degree of dependency** (`dependency_s3`),
    based on the block of questions `q6701_s3` (help from someone), `q6701b_s3`
    (problems with them) and `q6701d_s3` (need help). In this way, we find four
    categories:

    -   *No dependence*: has not received help because they didn't need it.
    -   *Dependency served*: has received the help needed
    -   *Problematic dependence*: has received help, but had problems with the
        person/people who helped them;
    -   *Neglected dependence*: needed help but didn't receive it.

-   Create four ordinal variables, one for **each specific type of abuse**. For
    each specific type of abuse, The first, dichotomous item of the pair is used
    to create the 0 (No abuse) category, and the second item its frequency,
    if abuse is present.

    -   `abuse_negli_s3`, negligence abuse: `q6702_s3`, `q6702a_s3`
    -   `abuse_psycho_s3`, psychological abuse: `q6703_s3`, `q6703a_s3`
    -   `abuse_eco_s3`, economical abuse: `q6704_s3`, `q6704a_s3`
    -   `abuse_phys_s3`, physical and sexual abuse: `q6705_s3`, `q6705a_s3`

First, the values are recoded. Given that in the original scale of the
questionnaire the items are coded as 1 = yes and 2 = no, the 2 are converted
into 0; and the 999 values are recoded into missings. This applies to all the
items involved in the creation of these variables.

The variable combines both frequency and presence / absence into a frequency
variable. Therefore, if in the first item the option replied is "yes", the
subsidiary item of frequency (which has the suffix "a") is used to create the
response scale: 0 = No abuse, 1 = Occasional, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Quite often, 4
= Often. See syntax below for more details.

To include the **grade of dependency** **in suspicion of abuse**,
`abuse_dep_s3` is created. This is a dichotomous variable that includes:

-   **No abuse in dependency**: "No dependency" or "Dependency served"
-   **Abuse within dependency**: "Problematic dependency" or "Neglected
    dependency"

Suspicion of abuse (`abusesuspicion_s3`) MAY be present (= 1) if any of the
types of abuse is greater than 0; otherwise, there is no suspicion of
abuse (= 0).
