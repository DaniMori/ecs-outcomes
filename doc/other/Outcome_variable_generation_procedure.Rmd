# Description document generation process

1.   Do "Pull" when opening R

2.   Create Branch from "*development*" branch, **not "main"**, with name
     `feature/c2011/w4/<outcome-variable>`

3.   Save .Rmd file to first create a commit with empty template

4.   Go to https://github.com/CCOMS-UAM/ecs-outcomes

5.   Generate a new Pull Request with `development`as base branch,
     instead of `main`.
     
6.   Fill in template with the information in the description document
     (resolving all the "TO-DOs")

7.   Check that the document knits without errors and the dataset is generated

8.   When committing, check that you are in the right branch

9.   Do "Push" after committing.

10.  Use checklist.md to quality-check the new description document

11.  Assign the designated "Reviewer" as a reviewer in the PR in Github
